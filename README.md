# Skin + Me - Tech Assessment - Full Stack

## The Task

The team has been creating a new checkout flow for the website. The basic app has been built. Now, we need to develop the ability to add products to a basket, allow the customer to pay, and finally, enable completing the order by sending it for fulfilment in the factory.

In this repository, you will find a simple React front-end which has a landing page and a shipping form, and a Flask back-end with some entities defined using SQLAlchemy and a simple endpoint.

**In the [issues](https://github.com/skinandme/pairing-full-stack-assessment/issues) tab you will find 3 tickets of increasing difficulty for you to work through. Unless told differently, please complete all three for this assessment. The tasks are labeled with the order they should be completed as they build on each other.**

Although some code is provided, you are welcome to change, replace, or discard any parts you see fit. You can use any resources you would normally use (e.g. Google Search, StackOverflow, etc) and feel free to reach out if you would like further guidance on the task at any point (this will not impact your assessment negatively). **The React front-end is provided for your convenience. If you are not comfortable with React, or any front-end technologies, you are welcome to not use any and instead either stub endpoints or provide a Postman collection (or equivalent) for running your code.**

If you have difficulty running the project, please let us know. We wanted to give you something to get you started quickly so you can focus on coding, so this should work with little configuration and we are not testing you on anything in this area.

We expect the overall tasks to take between 2-3 hours to complete. Please do not worry if completing all tasks in this time is not possible. Get as far as you can and we can discuss. We would also be happy to see comments/pseudocode for any areas you do not have time to explore. Good luck!

## Further Guidance

So you know what we are looking for, the following is a list of themes we will use to assess your work.

- Knowledge and understanding of Python, Relational Databases and general backend development (to a lesser extent, we will also be considering your knowledge of SQLAlchemy and Flask, but this will not form the majority of the assessment).
- Understanding of architecture and system design.
- Clean code and use of standards.
- Awareness of testing and testability.
- Consideration given to productionisation.
- Comments in your code for anything you want to convey your thought process or what you might do given more time.
- README on how to start your project, plus any other information you feel is relevant.
- We would like you to create a private repository in your github account and commit your code to it. We would urge you to commit relatively frequently so we can get an idea of your style and approach

_The below tasks are entirely optional and will not impact the main assessment. However, if you feel any are important to show off your knowledge and skillset particularly, please feel free to add or tell us if you want to discuss at the follow up interview._

- _Unit tests_
- _Dockerisation of front end application_
- _Integration with 3rd party services (e.g. Stripe - https://github.com/stripe/stripe-mock)_
- _Running the application in the cloud_
- _A/B testing_

# Skin + Me - Pairing Assessment - Full Stack

At Skin + Me we believe pair-programming is a vital skill for a modern developer. Being able to work alongside someone, explaining your thought process and getting instant feedback on your coding choices can make the developer experience more efficient, results in higher code quality, improves knowledge and skill acquisition and, hopefully, is more fun.

In this assessment you will be working alongside one (or two) of our developers. Don't worry, they are there help you, not trip you up. You can and should ask questions of them and they will guide you through the challenges to create something together. This assessment is as much about how you work with the team as it is your programming ability and is an opportunity for you to see if you can work with us in our (hopefully warm and welcoming) environment.

## The Task

This repo contains the beginnings of a simple checkout flow (similar to one we actually use). There is a simple React front-end which has a landing page and shipping form, and a Flask back-end with some entities defined using SQLAlchemy. Your task is to connect the front-end and back-end together using REST APIs. Some of the work is already completed, but you are welcome to change or discard any pieces you see fit. You can use any resources you would normally use (e.g. Google Search, StackOverflow, etc) and obviously discuss your approaches and ideas with the developer(s) pairing with you. Good luck!

## Guidance

What weâ€™d like to see

- Well structured code with thought given to reusability of components.
- Explanations of your approach as you go.
- README on how to start your project.
- We would like you to create a private repository in your github account and commit your code to it. We would urge you to commit relatively frequently so we can get an idea of your style and approach

_Not required but would be interesting to see if you feel it is important or shows off your knowledge and skillset particularly_

- Unit tests
- Dockerisation of front end application
- Integration with 3rd party services
- Running the application in the cloud
- A/B testing

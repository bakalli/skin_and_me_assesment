# Skin + Me - Pairing Assessment - Full Stack

## The Task

A developer has been working through this ticket:

> As a customer, I want to be able to add my address details to my order, so that I can have the product shipped to my chosen address.
>
> This task should include:
>
> - [x] ~A shipping details page built in React~
> - [x] ~Creation of a checkout flow~
> - [x] ~Creation of models that define the various aspects of a customer~
> - [ ] A REST endpoint (or endpoints) that can handle the submission of the above data.
> - [ ] Storage of the shipping details in the database.

This repository contains an implementation a developer has begun to work on to deliver this ticket. There is a simple React front-end which has a landing page and shipping form, and a Flask back-end with some entities defined using SQLAlchemy. You are tasked with taking over this developers work to finish the ticket. Although some of the work is already completed, you are welcome to change or discard any pieces you see fit. You can use any resources you would normally use (e.g. Google Search, StackOverflow, etc) and feel free to reach out if you would like further guidance on the task at any point (this will not impact your assessment negatively). Good luck!

## Guidance

What weâ€™d like to see

- Well structured code with thought given to reusability (DRY programming principles).
- Comments in your code for anything you want to convey thought process or what you might do with more time.
- README on how to start your project, plus any other information you feel is relevant.
- We would like you to create a private repository in your github account and commit your code to it. We would urge you to commit relatively frequently so we can get an idea of your style and approach

_Not required but would be interesting to see if you feel it is important or shows off your knowledge and skillset particularly_

- Unit tests
- Dockerisation of front end application
- Integration with 3rd party services
- Running the application in the cloud
- A/B testing
